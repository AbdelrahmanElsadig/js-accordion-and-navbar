                        <p>JavaScript, was originally named Mocha, later it was renamed to LiveScript, and then to
                            JavaScript.

                            The language was then submitted for standarization to the ECMA International Organization.
                            By that time, Netscape didn't allow the use of the "JavaScript" name, so the standarized
                            language is named ECMAScript.</p>

                            With JavaScript, you can also build cross-platform mobile apps and desktop apps.

                            Now, JavaScript is increasingly being used for maching learning and artificial intelligence
                            as well. Usually when it comes to machine learning, R and Python are more popular but JS is
                            fully capable of doing maching learning and AI and has many libraries built specifically for
                            them. It's just that JavaScript is not hyped up as much for machine learning as the other
                            two.</p>
